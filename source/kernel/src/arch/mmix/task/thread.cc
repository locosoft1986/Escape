/*
 * A few words to cloning and thread-switching on MMIX...
 * Unfortunatly, its a bit more complicated than on ECO32 and i586. There are two problems:
 * 1. The kernel-stack is accessed over the directly mapped space. That means, the address for
 *    every thread is different. Thus, we can't simply copy the kernel-stack, because the stack
 *    might contain pointers to the stack (which can't be distinguished from ordinary integers).
 * 2. It seems to be impossible to save the state somewhere and resume this state later. Because,
 *    when using SAVE the current stack is unusable before we've used UNSAVE to switch to another
 *    context. So, we can't continue after SAVE, but have to do an UNSAVE directly after the SAVE,
 *    i.e. the same assembler routine has to do that to ensure that the the stack is not accessed.
 *
 * The first problem can be solved by the following trick: When cloning, copy the current stack
 * to a temporary page. Then, leave the kernel directly (!) with the parent and make sure that the
 * parent gets a different stack next time when entering the kernel. As soon as the clone wants to
 * run, the stuff on the temporary page is copied to the page that the parent used for the stack
 * at the time we've cloned it. This way, pointers to the stack are no problem, because the same
 * stack-address is used by the clone.
 * Therefore, we introduce archAttr.tempStack to store the frame-number of the temporary stack for
 * a thread. When cloning, copy the stack to it and when the parent returns from thread_initSave,
 * switch the stack with the clone and leave the kernel. But there is still a problem: The
 * SAVE $X,1 at the beginning of a trap uses rSS for the kernel-stack. The corresponding UNSAVE 1,$X
 * uses rSS as well to know the beginning. Thus, we can't simply change rSS for the parent before
 * the UNSAVE 1,$X has been executed. Thus, we have to pass it in some way to the point after UNSAVE.
 * Fortunatly, our rK is always -1 in userspace, i.e. $255 can be directly set before the RESUME 1.
 * Therefore, $255 on the stack (created by SAVE 1,$X) can be used to hold the value of rSS.
 * So, finally, intrpt_forcedTrap does always set $255 on the stack to (2^63 | kstack * PAGE_SIZE),
 * which is put into rSS after UNSAVE.
 * => REALLY inconvenient and probably not very efficient. But I don't see a better solution...
 *
 * The second problem forces us to use a different thread-switch-mechanismn than in ECO32 and i586.
 * Because the old one relies on the opportunity to save the state at any place and resume it later.
 * Since we have to do the SAVE and the RESUME directly after another, we provide the function
 * Thread::doSwitchTo and use it when switching the thread. This is no problem in Thread::doSwitch()
 * and the initial state can be created by thread_initSave. This one is rather tricky as well. It
 * performs a SAVE at first to write the whole state to memory, copies the register- and software-
 * stack to newStack, writes rWW, ..., rZZ and the end of the stack to saveArea and executes an
 * UNSAVE from the previous SAVE. That means we're doing:
 * SAVE $255,0
 * ... copy ...
 * UNSAVE 0,$255
 * This way, the current stack remains usable and a copy has been created. Of course, we do more
 * than necessary, because most of the values wouldn't need to be restored. The only important ones
 * are rS and rO, which can't be set directly.
